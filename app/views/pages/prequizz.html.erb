      What is Spiral Dynamics
    </h2>
    <ul class="prequizz-guidelines">
      <li class="prequizz-instruction"><strong>Spiral Dynamics is a very powerful and complex model</strong> concerning the evolution of human consciousness. It was initially introduced by Dr. Clare Graves in the 1950s and since then, numerous data-based studies have been carried around the subject, since many understand how powerful the model can be</li>
      <li class="prequizz-instruction">The theory indicates that <strong>there is a certain directionality in how the human psyche evolves and is able to accurately predict how the way you see the world develops over time</strong></li>
      <li class="prequizz-instruction">Think about this: <strong>There has been over 70 billion humans born in this planet</strong>. Over centuries, the way they saw the world has changed drastically, <strong>and it changed in a predictable pattern. This pattern happens to repeat from one country to another and from one stage of life to the next</strong>. It applies to individuals, countries, business, families, group of friends and many other structures</li>
      <li class="prequizz-instruction">The evolution of the psyche could be divided in many ways. However, the names behind this theory decided to <strong>divide the evolution into different stages, with each stage being represented by a color</strong></li>
      <li class="prequizz-instruction">Therefore, by having a deep understanding of these stages, <strong> with both its strengths and weaknesses</strong>, you will be able to understand what are the common pitfalls of each stage and <strong>you will be more likely to develop your consciousness further with more awareness and less resistance</strong>. <strong>This is why Spiral Dynamics is seen as a huge personal development tool</strong></li>
      <li class="prequizz-instruction">In addition, you will be able to <strong>understand the cause of all conflicts in politics and economy, and what is behind the way people think, and how they can be so convicted of opinions which are different than yours</strong>. Therefore, <strong>you will be able to interact with others in a much clearer way, understand where they are coming from, and finally be able to devise impactful solutions that can generate value for you and the others much easier</strong></li>
    </ul>

      The quizz
    </h2>
    <ul class="prequizz-guidelines">
      <li class="prequizz-instruction">The quizz is composed of <strong>23 questions</strong> and will take you approximately <strong>10 minutes</strong> to complete</li>
      <li class="prequizz-instruction">At the end of the 23 questions, you will receive your result. <strong>The result shows the percentage of resonance you have with each of the stages in the model</strong>.</li>
      <li class="prequizz-instruction"><strong>A negative resonance means you have seen the limitations of a stage and moved past it, or it means that that stage is ahead of you and you still have resistance towards its ideas.</strong> Remember, each stage of the spiral rejects the ones below or above it</li>
      <li class="prequizz-instruction">A <strong>small positive resonance (< 40%) means you are leaving or entering that stage</strong></li>
      <li class="prequizz-instruction">A <strong>big positive resonance (> 40%) indicates most of your mode of thinking belongs to that stage</strong></li>
      <li class="prequizz-instruction">Remember: a stage that is above yours is not necessarily better than yours, nor is yours better than the previous. <strong>The goal of this model is not to place people at categories and then judge them as better or worse</strong>. It simply states that there are different modes of thinking that have a certain directionality to it, and understanding your mode of thinking is key to understand what lies ahead and how others operate. <strong>Being open-minded enough to see the possible limitations of your mode of thinking and to contemplate about the possibilities of the next will not only make you more likely to develop, but it might save many disappointments in the future</strong></li>
    </ul>

      Disclaimers
    </h2>
    <ul class="prequizz-guidelines">
      <li class="prequizz-instruction">Only the four stages with which the vast majority of modern human beings resonate with are contemplated in the test. However, if you are taking this quizz, <strong>you will certainly fall into one of these stages</strong></li>
      <li class="prequizz-instruction"><strong>This is not a professional assessment</strong>. You should not take the results completely for granted, but surely <strong>the quizz is capable of accurately assessing your stage of development and give you powerful insights about how to go further</strong></li>
      <li class="prequizz-instruction">If you already started or finished the quizz, clicking on the proceed button will resume where you left. If this is the first time, the quizz will start right away</li>
